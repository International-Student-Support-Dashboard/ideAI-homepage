        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>Welcome to ideAI, where we harness the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to revolutionize educational assessment. Our mission is to provide holistic assessment solutions that empower educators and learners alike. We bring to our assessments the conceptualization of students as self-actualizing, determined learners with many skills and many challenges. Through this lens we focus on building and evaluating the broad range of capacities students can show through multi-modal assessment, powered by AI.</p>
        <p>ideAI is the result of several projects headed by Dr. Eunice Eunhee Jang, a Proffesor at the Ontario Institute of Studies in Education (OISE). After several years of warm reception from students, parents, teachers and administrators, we have expanded our capacity and are looking to partner with schoolboards, individual schools, and Universities to share the value we can bring. Please reach out if you are interested in any of our assessment services.</p>
